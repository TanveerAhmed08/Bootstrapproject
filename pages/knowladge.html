            <h1>The Untold Story of a Rescued Pangolin</h1>
            <img class="glow" src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/1100x600?pangolin" alt="">
            <p>It was dinner time, and I was hungry for ants and termites. It was time to go out of my burrow. With my small eyes and long muzzle, I ventured out into the darkness, searching through the bushes and undergrowth. This is how I, a pangolin, spend my days—solitary, nocturnal, and always on the prowl for food.

                There wasn't much luck in finding dinner all alone. So, I decided to wait for my friends and search with them as they must have been on their way too. I was waiting near a bush when I heard my friends from far away. I was excited to see them. We communicate with vocalisations, body postures, and scent glands. As the rustling and crackling of leaves grew louder, I anticipated the joyful reunion. But what I saw left me terrified—a tall man, his legs and shoes looming before me! I tried to shrink into the safety of the bush, but the poacher's eyes probed through the foliage.
                
                Panic surged as I realised I couldn't outrun the poacher.
                
                Gasping for breath, I knew it was time to resort to my defensive mode. With determination, I gathered the strength to curl into a tight ball, my large overlapping scales forming an impenetrable shield against the looming threat. In that moment of vulnerability, I found my strength, hoping it would be enough to prevent the danger closing in. As I huddled in my defensive ball, the poacher's rough hands closed around me, prying me from the safety of my armour. With a sinking heart, I realised escape was pointless. The poacher's voice, harsh and menacing, cut through the night air as he discussed his plans for me with his companions.
                
                As they carried me and walked back, I listened in terror to their cruel intentions. They spoke of markets and profits, of my scales prized for their supposed medicinal purposes, and of a fate far worse than capture. Each word sent shivers down my spine, filling me with a profound sense of dread. Despite my fear, I clung to the hope that somehow, someway, I would find means of escape.
                
                For days, they kept me in a cage, and I felt so helpless. All I could do was hear them talking about selling me on the internet. Their laughter was evil. Would I be stuck forever, my scales taken away and sold? The uncertainty gnawed at me, and scary questions ran through my mind.
                
                Then, the day arrived. The poacher, his grip tight around me, handed me over to the waiting buyer. My heart became heavy as I found myself in new hands. But then, something unexpected happened. The person holding me said,
                
                “You all are in big trouble, and you will be heavily fined now for capturing this innocent species."
                
                Little did I know, the person holding me wasn't just an ordinary buyer; they were a rescuer in disguise. At that moment, I realised that my rescuer had played a clever game, infiltrating the poachers' scheme to save me from a life of captivity and exploitation. Hurray! It was a reminder that amidst the darkness, there are still those who will go to great lengths to protect innocent species like me. He gave me a second chance, a shot at a life without fear and harm.

                From June 2023 till now, 28 pangolins from different parts of Pakistan have been rescued. 
                
                The Punjab Wildlife Department's Rawalpindi team acts upon receiving alerts, initiating rescue operations promptly. With assistance from WWF-Pakistan and Dr Tariq Mahmood of PMAS Arid Agriculture University, the rescued pangolins are released in a protected pangolin zone, special areas set up to keep pangolins safe from harm and trafficking. A small radio transmitter has been affixed to their scaly bodies, allowing experts to monitor their movements to ensure their safety from all threats and a future where these incredible creatures thrive in their natural habitats.</p>
                <h1>Regenerative Agriculture – How Traditional Farming Meets Modernity for Sustainable Agriculture in Pakistan</h1>
                <p>Pakistan has the fifth largest population in the world with an agriculture sector that spans across the length of the country. The country is of critical agri-geographical importance in Asia by virtue of its central position, and a population that is five per cent of the entire continent. Agriculture is the heartbeat of the country and employs around 40 per cent of the total population. Pakistan also stands as a top producer of various cash and food crops including cotton, rice, wheat, etc. 

 

                    With the advent of the green revolution, which started back in the 1960s, Pakistan out-performed major Asian countries including India and Bangladesh in the agriculture sector. Over the past few decades Pakistan, which is supposedly a food surplus country, has been declared food insecure which subsequently leads to malnutrition, wasting, stunting, etc. The unregulated usage of fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, and other harmful chemicals is a leading cause of the overall deterioration of the natural environment and habitat. Using these excessively disturbs the agricultural landscape; reducing soil organic matter, increasing pest resistance, alteration in soil structure, and reduction in soil and land biodiversity. This decline hasn't transpired abruptly, rather, it has evolved steadily over the course of decades to show the natural consequences of synthetic chemical farming in the country.
                    
                    Over time, farmers in the country have opted for modern farming systems by applying excessive synthetic fertilizers and pest-disease controlling agents in order to get higher yields. Moreover, most farmers cultivate the same crops, around the year, over a period of time such as rice-wheat or cotton-wheat. This mono-cropping technique has altered the soil structure including the natural biodiversity and soil nutrient make-up. There is now a dire need to opt for a natural farming system or traditional farming system which is helpful for overall the sustainability of agriculture, people and nature in the country. 
                    
                     
                    
                    The growing and widespread global demand for crops grown sustainably aligns with the need for a shift in farming practices, pushing farmers to reconsider their methods. Even multinational companies are now encouraging farmers to prioritize responsible sourcing from farms and adopting regenerative agriculture principles.
                    
                     
                    
                    Regenerative agriculture is a multidimensional approach that fosters the agri-ecosystem while conserving the natural resources and building community resilience. This agriculture system is a way of farming where soil is minimally disturbed to improve the soil biodiversity, water retention capacity, organic matter, and nutrients to grow crops while ensuring the sustainable usage of natural resources. Contrary to this, in conventional farming soil is usually dug up and left bare after the harvest. This process of tilling and ploughing erodes the soil, depletes the soil nutrients and hence releases a large amount of carbon dioxide. Regenerative agriculture however does not make use of tilling practices which reduce the physical disturbance of the soil and hence maintain the soil structure while preventing its erosion. 
                    
                     
                    
                    This system also increases soil fertility by planting cover crops, promoting crop rotation and applying compost-manures as those restore the soil microbiome which unleash the nutrients. In contrast to that, synthetic fertilizers used in conventional farming systems creates an imbalance in the structure and function of the soil biodiversity.
                    
                     
                    
                    The regenerative agriculture system is unique because it draws on traditional knowledge but also relies on modern approaches as compared to intensive, synthetic, conventional farming systems. It is imperative now that both public and private agriculture sectors must align their priorities with farming communities to revive the food and agriculture sector of Pakistan by motivating and raising awareness among the farmers about the benefits of this system in Pakistan. In doing so, they must emphasise on the business case for regenerative agriculture by showcasing and highlighting the success stories where the system has proven to be beneficial. These success stories extend to responsible sourcing, certification, higher market values, consumer satisfaction, and above all improved nature and livelihoods of the vulnerable farming communities. If there can be sustained and targeted investment in this practice, Pakistan’s agriculture can be revitalised, and with it the livelihoods of millions of people and the overall economy.</p>
